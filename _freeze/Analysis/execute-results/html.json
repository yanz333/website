It is freely available on [PhysioNet](https://doi.org/10.13026/51h0-a262).\n\n### Research Question\n\nWe wanted to fingerprint or identify the individuals based on their raw accelerometry data.\n\n### Exploratory Analysis\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe first made plots to visualize the demographics of the 32 participants. There are 13 men and 19 women, and around 75% of them are white. Additionally, 31 out of 32 subjects are right-handed, and one individual identified herself as ambidextrous.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nRaw accelerometry walking data collected from left wrist for the selected subject is plotted over a 10s time interval. We took the vector magnitude of the amplitudes from 3 axes.\n\n### Methods\n\n<center>![](outfile.gif){width=\"65%\"}</center>\n\nWe first translated the signals for all subjects over a small time interval (such as 0.25s as shown) so that we have pairs of the original (u) and time-lagged (s) signals starting from 0.25s. The animated figure above shows the first pair of u and s signals as the red dots. We obtained all the possible pairs and investigated their densities (autoregressive distributions) at each s-u interval for every individual. Please see a more in-depth visualization in the [R-shiny app](https://yanzhang3.shinyapps.io/denPub/). We then fitted functional and logistic regressions to identify the subjects.\n\n### Results\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that accelerometry fingerprinting has been implemented with the 100% success rate. We believe that our model is able to capture the unique walking patterns for each study participant, which may find applications in forensics, health monitoring and recovery management.\n",
