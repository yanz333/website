    "text": "Research Question\nWe wanted to fingerprint or identify the individuals based on their raw accelerometry data.\n\n\nExploratory Analysis\n\n\n\n\n\nWe first made plots to visualize the demographics of the 32 participants. There are 13 men and 19 women, and around 75% of them are white. Additionally, 31 out of 32 subjects are right-handed, and one individual identified herself as ambidextrous.\n\n\n\n\n\nRaw accelerometry walking data collected from left wrist for the selected subject is plotted over a 10s time interval. We took the vector magnitude of the amplitudes from 3 axes.\n\n\nMethods\n\n\n\nWe first translated the signals for all subjects over a small time interval (such as 0.25s as shown) so that we have pairs of the original (u) and time-lagged (s) signals starting from 0.25s. The animated figure above shows the first pair of u and s signals as the red dots. We obtained all the possible pairs and investigated their densities (autoregressive distributions) at each s-u interval for every individual. Please see a more in-depth visualization in the R-shiny app. We then fitted functional and logistic regressions to identify the subjects.\n\n\nResults\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that accelerometry fingerprinting has been implemented with the 100% success rate. We believe that our model is able to capture the unique walking patterns for each study participant, which may find applications in forensics, health monitoring and recovery management."
